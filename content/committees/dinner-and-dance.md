The event takes place at various locations each year, offering a night filled with festivities to ensure all hall residents have an enjoyable time. In addition to food, the event features entertainment from the hall's residents and occasionally, external performers.

Every D&D is also accompanied with a Hall Pageant, whereby at the end of the night, a Hall King and Queen will be crowned."
